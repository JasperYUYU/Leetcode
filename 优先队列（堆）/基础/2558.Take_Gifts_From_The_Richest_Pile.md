# 2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile

You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:

- Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
- If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
- Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

Return *the number of gifts remaining after* `k` *seconds.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
Output: 29
Explanation: 
The gifts are taken in the following way:
- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: 
In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. 
That is, you can't take any pile with you. 
So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= gifts.length <= 103`
- `1 <= gifts[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= k <= 103`

## 算法

堆

1. 使用堆模拟整个过程，初始化答案为所有礼物数量的总和，模拟过程中逐渐减少
2. 注意到，如果某个礼物的数量变到了1， 则无需再次进堆

## 时间复杂度

- 建堆的时间复杂度为O(n)
- 每个数字m最多被进堆出堆loglogm次， 所以总共会有O(min(k, nloglogm))次操作堆
- 故总时间复杂度为O(n+min(k, nloglogm)logn)

## 空间复杂度

需要O(n)的额外空间存储堆

## 代码

我的代码：

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long pickGifts(vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> heap(gifts.begin(), gifts.end());

        while(k--) {
          int a = heap.top(); 
          heap.pop();
          heap.push(sqrt(a));
        }

        long long sum = 0;
        
        while (!heap.empty()) {
          sum += heap.top();
          heap.pop();
        }

        return sum;
    }
};
```

大佬代码：

```cpp
#define LL long long

class Solution {
public:
    LL pickGifts(vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> heap(gifts.begin(), gifts.end());

        LL ans = 0;
        for (int x : gifts)
            ans += x;

        while (!heap.empty() && k) {
            --k;

            int t = heap.top();
            heap.pop();

            ans -= t - sqrt(t);
            t = sqrt(t);

            if (t > 1)
                heap.push(t);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
